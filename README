  default*.jpg: wallpapers, also used by various svg in subdirectories

  gnome/morning*.jpg gnome/night*.jpg dynamic-wallpaper.xml.in: files used to
  create the dynamic wallpaper used by GNOME. See gnome/README for more
  details.

  yast/background.png: a reprise of the wallpaper

Note that the current setup assumes we ship the wallpapers in two resolutions:
  1600x1200 (4:3)
  1920:1200 (16:9)

If you want to add a new resolution, please be careful to update everything. A
good way to do this is to grep the directory for 1920.


How to update the wallpaper in the distribution
===============================================

1) Create openSUSE.tar.gz with make

Simply type 'make' to create openSUSE.tar.gz:

  pushd branding
  git checkout 12.3
  make
  popd

2) Update the data in the branding-openSUSE package

The following commands will branch the branding-openSUSE package, commit the new
data and submit the changes:

  osc branch openSUSE:Factory branding-openSUSE -c
  cp branding/openSUSE.tar.gz home:*branches*/branding-openSUSE
  cd home:*branches*/branding-openSUSE
  osc vc
  osc ci
  osc sr
    -> created request id XXXXX


How to create artwork for a new version of openSUSE
===================================================

Simply copy all files from this directory to a new directory, and change:

 - the NAME variable at the top of Makefile to the name of the artwork theme
   for the version of openSUSE you target.
 - the VERSION variable at the top of Makefile to the version of openSUSE you
   target.
